Controller Mapping
------------------

Everything in this mapping is standard except:
 - the Level knobs have been remapped to a filter effect,
 - the browse encoder has two added features:
    - it can be used to preview tracks when clicking on a track in a tracklist,
    - scrolling the encoder allows seeking the previewed track,
    - clicking when a track is being previewed will stop the preview, allowing you to scroll the tracklist again.
