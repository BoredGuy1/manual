"The American Audio VMS2 is a 2-deck all-in-one controller. It is a USB class"
" compliant MIDI and audio device that works with GNU/Linux, Mac OS X, and "
"Windows. It features a 4 channel input and 4 channel output sound card with "
"2 phono preamps. The main output has XLR and RCA outputs (do not use both at"
" once). There is a separate RCA booth output. The VMS2 can also be used as a"
" stand-alone mixer with analog sources without a computer by setting the "
"USB/Analog switches on the front of the device to “Analog”."
